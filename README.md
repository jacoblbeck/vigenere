SAMPLE VECTORS FOR VIGENERE LAB
-------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

This archive contains sample input, keys, output and a testing script
to perform encoding/decoding for each input and key combination.

Contents:

`input/` -- sample inputs  
`keys/` -- sample keys  
`correct/` -- correctly encoded inputs by key  
`ENCODED/` -- output directory for test encodings  
`DECODED/` -- output directory for test decodings  
`checksums/` -- files for integrity testing  
`log/` -- output from encoder/decoder  
`test.sh` -- runs tests  

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Copy your `vigenere.c` file into this directory. Run `./test.sh`. This will compile your code to generate `encoder` and `decoder` and run all combinations of inputs and keys. Encoded data is written into `ENCODED/` and compared against the correct version in `correct/`. Decoded data is written into `DECODED/` and compared against the original input in `input/`.  Standard output and error for your programs are written to files in `log/`.

A special integrity test will verify that your code has not accidentally modified the test data.

Successes and failures are counted (including compilation) and results are printed at the end.

See `./test.sh -h` for special options, including disabling integrity testing.
